# Efficient Ad Optimization System

An advanced ad optimization system that uses reinforcement learning and deep learning to maximize ad performance across multiple objectives (CTR, conversion, and revenue).

## Key Features

- **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Simultaneously optimizes for CTR, conversion rate, and revenue
- **Advanced ML Models**:
  - Deep learning with attention mechanisms
  - Thompson Sampling for exploration
  - Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) for exploitation
  - Contextual bandits for personalized ad selection
- **Real-time Optimization**: Dynamic ad selection based on user context and behavior
- **User Profiling**: Personalized ad delivery based on user interaction history
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualize performance metrics and optimization results
- **Performance Tracking**: Comprehensive metrics and visualization tools

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/efficient_ad_optimization.git
cd efficient_ad_optimization
```

2. **Set up virtual environment** (recommended):
```bash
# Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Linux/Mac
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Generate sample data**:
```bash
python generate_sample_data.py
```

5. **Run the optimization system**:
```bash
python ad_optimizer.py
```

6. **Launch the dashboard**:
```bash
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

## How It Works

### 1. Data Processing
- Loads and preprocesses ad data
- Normalizes features using StandardScaler
- Splits data into training and testing sets

### 2. Model Architecture
- **Feature Extraction**: Deep neural network with attention mechanism
- **Multi-Objective Heads**: Separate prediction heads for CTR, conversion, and revenue
- **User Profiling**: Tracks user preferences and interaction history
- **Context Processing**: Advanced context modeling with self-attention

### 3. Optimization Process
1. Receives user context and available ads
2. Uses hybrid approach for ad selection:
   - Thompson Sampling for exploration
   - UCB for exploitation
   - Contextual model for personalization
3. Shows selected ad to user
4. Updates model based on observed rewards
5. Adjusts user profiles and preferences

### 4. Performance Monitoring
- Tracks multiple metrics:
  - Click-Through Rate (CTR)
  - Conversion rate
  - Revenue
  - User engagement
- Generates performance visualizations
- Saves best performing models
